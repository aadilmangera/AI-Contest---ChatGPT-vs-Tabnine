    "### Prompt:\n",
    "Bessie is looking for a new job! Fortunately, K farmers are currently hiring and conducting interviews. Since jobs are highly competitive, the farmers have decided to number and interview cows in the order they applied. There are N cows that applied before Bessie, so her number is N+1 (1≤K≤N≤3⋅10$^{5}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The interview process will go as follows. At time 0, farmer i will start interviewing cow i for each 1≤i≤K.\n",
    " Once a farmer finishes an interview, he will immediately begin interviewing the next cow in line. If multiple farmers finish at the same time, the next cow may choose to be interviewed by any of the available farmers, according to her preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each 1≤i≤N, Bessie already knows that cow i's interview will take exactly ti minutes (1≤ti≤10$^{9}$).\n",
    " However, she doesn't know each cow's preference of farmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this job is very important to Bessie, she wants to carefully prepare for her interview. To do this, she needs to know when she will be interviewed and which farmers could potentially interview her. Help her find this information!\n",
    "\n",
    "INPUT FORMAT (input arrives from the terminal / stdin):\n",
    "The first line of the input will contain two integers N and K.\n",
    "The second line will contain N integers t1…tN.\n",
    "\n",
    "OUTPUT FORMAT (print output to the terminal / stdout):\n",
    "On the first line, print the time Bessie's interview will begin.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the second line, a bit string of length K, where the i-th bit is 1 if farmer i could interview Bessie and 0 otherwise.\n",

    "There are 6 cows aside from Bessie and 3 farmers, and the interview process will go as follows:\n",

    "At time t=0, farmer 1 interviews cow 1, farmer 2 interviews cow 2, and farmer 3 interviews cow 3.\n",

    "Farmer 1 interviews cow 6 and farmer 2 interviews cow 5.\n",
    "In this case, farmer 1 would finish his interview at time t=8 and start interviewing Bessie.\n",

    "To solve this problem efficiently, we can simulate the interview process using a priority queue (min-heap), which allows us to efficiently determine which farmer finishes their interview first. Let's break down the solution step-by-step:\n",

    "Farmers conduct interviews sequentially, and the next available farmer (i.e., the one who finishes their current interview first) will take the next cow in line.\n",

    "Use a min-heap to track the farmers, where each element is a tuple (finish_time, farmer_id) representing the time when a farmer will finish their current interview.\n",
    "Initially, assign the first K cows to the K farmers. Each farmer starts interviewing a cow at time = 0.\n",
    "Simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Process the remaining N - K cows one by one:\n",
    "Extract the farmer who finishes their interview the earliest.\n",
    "Assign the next cow to that farmer, and update the farmer's finish_time.\n",
    "Continue until all cows before Bessie are assigned.\n",
    "Bessie's Interview:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all cows before Bessie are assigned, the earliest finish_time in the heap will be the time when Bessie's interview begins.\n",
    "Any farmer with the same finish_time is a candidate for interviewing Bessie.\n",
