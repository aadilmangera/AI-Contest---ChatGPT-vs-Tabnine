    "After years of hosting games and watching Bessie get first place over and over, Farmer John has realized that this can't be accidental. Instead, he concludes that Bessie must have winning coded into her DNA so he sets out to find this \"winning\" gene.\n",
    "\n",
    "He devises a process to identify possible candidates for this \"winning\" gene. He takes Bessie's genome, which is a string S of length N where 1≤N≤3000. He picks some pair (K,L) where 1≤L≤K≤N representing that the \"winning\" gene candidates will have length L and will be found within a larger K length substring. To identify the gene, he takes all K length substrings from S which we will call a k-mer. For a given k-mer, he takes all length L substrings, identifies the lexicographically minimal substring as a winning gene candidate (choosing the leftmost such substring if there is a tie), and then writes down the 0-indexed position pi where that substring starts in S to a set P.\n",
