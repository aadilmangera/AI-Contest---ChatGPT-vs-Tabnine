    "After years of hosting games and watching Bessie get first place over and over, Farmer John has realized that this can't be accidental. Instead, he concludes that Bessie must have winning coded into her DNA so he sets out to find this \"winning\" gene.\n",
    "\n",
    "He devises a process to identify possible candidates for this \"winning\" gene. He takes Bessie's genome, which is a string S of length N where 1≤N≤3000. He picks some pair (K,L) where 1≤L≤K≤N representing that the \"winning\" gene candidates will have length L and will be found within a larger K length substring. To identify the gene, he takes all K length substrings from S which we will call a k-mer. For a given k-mer, he takes all length L substrings, identifies the lexicographically minimal substring as a winning gene candidate (choosing the leftmost such substring if there is a tie), and then writes down the 0-indexed position pi where that substring starts in S to a set P.\n",

    "The IndexError indicates that the data list is empty, which happens when no input is provided. This is a common issue when running scripts that expect input from stdin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resolving the Issue:\n",
    "If you're testing locally or in an environment where input isn't provided via standard input (like a notebook or IDE), modify the code to handle inputs directly (e.g., using input() or predefined test cases).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you can adjust it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use Hardcoded Input for Testing:\n",
    "Replace the input-reading block with direct assignment of N and S for local testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Test inputs\n",

    "# Run the function\n",
    "count_winning_gene_candidates(N, S)\n",
    "2. Use input() for Manual Testing:\n",
    "If you prefer entering inputs manually, modify the code to use input() calls:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "# Input reading\n",
    "N = int(input(\"Enter the length of the string: \"))\n",
    "S = input(\"Enter the string: \")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run the function\n",
    "count_winning_gene_candidates(N, S)\n",
    "3. Debugging Tips:\n",
    "If you're using sys.stdin.read, ensure that:\n",
    "\n",
    "You're running the script in an environment that provides standard input.\n",
    "The input format matches the expected format.\n",
    "For example, if you're running this in a script, the input should look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy code\n",
    "8\n",
    "AGTCAACG\n",
    "Run the script and provide input as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try these adjustments, and if you still encounter issues, let me know how you're testing the script so I can help further!"
