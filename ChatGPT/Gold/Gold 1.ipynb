    "The cows have formed a dance team, and Farmer John is their choreographer! The team's latest and greatest dance involves N cows (2≤N≤10$^{6}$) standing in a line. Each move in the dance involves two cows, up to K positions apart (1≤K<N), gracefully jumping and landing in each other's position.\n",

    " represents a Holstein, and the overall string represents how the cows are arranged in the line.\n",

    "Identify the positions of \"1\"s in both strings.\n",
    "Use a greedy algorithm or minimum-cost flow approach to calculate the minimum number of swaps required to align the positions.\n",
    "Algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract the indices of \"1\"s from both strings (positions_start and positions_end).\n",
    "Ensure that the number of \"1\"s matches; otherwise, output is invalid (but this is guaranteed in the problem).\n",
    "Use a sliding window approach to handle swaps up to K positions apart.\n",
    "Efficient Implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use two pointers to align the \"1\"s in positions_start and positions_end.\n",
    "Minimize the cost of alignment by considering the allowed distance K.\n",
