    "To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. We will create a 2D array `dp` of size `N+1` by `N+1`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to split the first `i` elements of the first array and the first `j` elements of the second array into non-empty subarrays while satisfying the constraints modulo `10^9 + 7`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can initialize `dp[0][0]` as 1, as there is only one way to split both arrays into an empty subarray.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, for each pair of indices `i` and `j` from 1 to `N`, we can calculate `dp[i][j]` using the following recurrence relation:\n",
