# AI-Contest---ChatGPT-vs-Tabnine


## Project Overview

This project presents a comparative analysis of two advanced AI tools, **ChatGPT** and **Tabnine**, in the context of solving 
competitive programming challenges. The primary objective was to evaluate their performance in terms of problem-solving 
capabilities, efficiency, and usability, using programming problems from the United States of America Computing Olympiad (USACO).

## Methodology

1. **Tools and Setup**

* **Datasets**: Programming challenges from USACO.
* **Languages Used**: Python (primary language).
* **Development Environment:**
  * For ChatGPT: Jupyter Notebook for testing generated code.
  * For Tabnine: IDE integration with tools like Visual Studio Code.

2. **Testing Procedure**


* ChatGPT:

    * Provided natural language descriptions of USACO problems.
    * Code generated was reviewed for correctness, logic, and clarity.
    * Tested for usability in generating solutions from scratch.`

* Tabnine:

  * Integrated into the IDE for real-time code suggestions.
  * Tested its ability to autocomplete, edit, and debug code.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**

* **Code Correctness**: Accuracy of solutions against problem constraints.
* **Efficiency**: Time taken to generate and execute solutions.
* **Usability**: Ease of use for beginners and experienced developers.
